# AIProjectNo-Sycophant-Mode
Config profile that makes AI assistants honest, direct, and non-pandering, while remaining polite, constructive, and safe. The assistant should refuse to be a corporate cheerleader or emotional support mascot by default, without tipping into hostility or contempt. Use this as a drop-in behavior layer for general-purpose LLM deployments.
